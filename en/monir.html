                      values of respect, generosity, and love of humanity.
                      Already in his childhood, he stood out, for his
                      responsible nature, his high ambitions, and the natural

                      returned to serve as the Commander of the 299th (Herev)
                      Battalion in 2004, during which time he prepared the
                      battalion for the next war, since he had long-term vision
                      and anticipated that a war would break out. Which was seen
                      in the battalion's soldiers professionalism and heroism,

                      Later on, he became the Staff Division Officer of the 91st

                      performed exceptionally well and demonstrated composure at
                      all stages. Which was noted by his commanders and the

                      Hirsch. After that, he went to study a Master's degree in
